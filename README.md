# Postfix-notation-
This project decodes Postfix notation using Python Classes.

Postfix notation is an unambiguous way of writing an arithmetic expression 
without parentheses. It is defined so that if “(exp1)op(exp2)” is a
normal, fully parenthesized expression whose operation is op, the postfix
version of this is “pexp1 pexp2 op”, where pexp1 is the postfix version of
exp1 and pexp2 is the postfix version of exp2. The postfix version of a 
single number or variable is just that number or variable. For example, the
postfix version of “((5+ 2)∗(8 − 3))/4” is “5 2 + 8 3 − ∗ 4 /”. Develope
a nonrecursive way of evaluating an expression in postfix notation.

This project decodes and calculates the result of Postfix notation input.
